The Arduino Uno steering wheel operates on the principle of translating physical movements into digital signals for control. Essentially, it functions through a series of components and processes: a 90-degree clockwise (90C) rotation of the wheel, Python script for serial communication, analog pins for potentiometer readings ranging from 0 to 1023 (equivalent to -1 to 1), and digital pins for button usage. Additionally, separate power sources are required for the pedal potentiometers to ensure that the Arduino can handle the load without overloading (up to 3 pedals).

The Arduino Uno serves as the central processing unit for this setup. It receives input from the steering wheel's rotation, which is converted into analog signals through potentiometers. These analog signals are then read by the Arduino Uno through its analog input pins. The range of values from 0 to 1023 represents the full range of rotation, mapped to a scale of -1 to 1 for ease of interpretation.

Python scripts are employed to facilitate communication between the Arduino Uno and the computer. These scripts read the serial data sent by the Arduino Uno, allowing for real-time monitoring and control of the steering wheel's movements.

In addition to steering control, the Arduino Uno also manages input from various buttons integrated into the steering wheel. Digital pins are utilized to detect the state of these buttons, enabling functions such as horn honking or gear shifting.

Furthermore, to prevent power overload and ensure smooth operation, separate power sources are allocated for the pedal potentiometers. By distributing the power load across multiple sources, the Arduino Uno can effectively manage the input from up to three pedals simultaneously without compromising performance or stability.

In summary, the Arduino Uno steering wheel operates by converting physical movements into digital signals through potentiometers and digital pins, with Python scripts facilitating communication for real-time control. Separate power sources are employed for pedal potentiometers to maintain operational efficiency and prevent overload.
